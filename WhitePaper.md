# Introduction
A casino is a business entity which houses and accommodates certain types of gambling activities and makes money due to its house edge. Therefore, Casinos are most commonly built near or combined with hotels, restaurants, retail shopping, cruise ships or other tourist attractions to attract more players. There is much debate over whether the social and economic consequences of casino gambling outweigh the initial revenue that may be generated. Some casinos are also known for hosting live entertainment events, such as stand-up comedy, concerts, and sporting events.
There have been many efforts to combat the house edge. Some strategies are based on skills and a few are controversial. Card counting has been one of them. Card counting is a casino card game strategy used primarily in the blackjack family of casino games to determine whether the next hand is likely to give a probable advantage to the player or to the dealer. Card counters are a class of advanced players, who attempt to decrease the inherent card house edge by keeping a running tally of all high and low valued cards seen by the player. Card counting allows players to bet more with less risk when the count gives an advantage as well as minimize losses during an unfavorable count. Card counting also provides the ability to alter playing decisions based on the composition of remaining cards. However, card counting has been considered illegal and against gambling law.

## The History of Gambling
> "Zeus, Hades and Poseidon are said to have split the Universe by sharing heaven, hell and sea with the throw of the dice.”

Gambling is one of the oldest known pursuits of mankind. Archeological evidence suggests that even the earliest caveman was a gambler. Dice-like objects made from the ankle bone of a sheep or dog called “Astragali” dating back 40,000 years have been found. Cave drawings depicting gambling offer further proof of the existence of early gamblers. Pairs of dice have even turned up in the ruins of Pompeii, some of them "loaded" to fall a certain way.

Gambling involves risking something of value on an uncertain event in hopes of winning something of greater value. Americans point to Las Vegas, but it is common worldwide and occurs at gas stations, church halls, and casinos, including those offshore and online. It is more popular than ever thanks to multi-million dollar winners, sports fantasy leagues, and World Series of Poker tournaments on televisions. Gambling begins with a wager. Games such as slot machines and keno ask for a fixed amount to play. Casino table games such as poker or baccarat require a minimum bet to participate, and they may or may not have betting limits.

Online gambling includes poker, casinos and sports betting. The first online casino was in 1994. Many countries restrict or ban online gambling, but it is legal in some provinces in Canada, most countries of the European Union and several nations in the Caribbean. The Internet has made way for new types of gambling to form online. Improvements in technology have changed betting habits just as video lottery terminals, keno and scratchcards changed the gambling industry in the early 20th century.

## Problems of Online Gambling
### House Edge
For online casinos, most of the profit comes from the “House Edge”. The House Edge is the mathematical advantage that the casino has over you as you play. This makes casinos profitable by assured returns over the time. And this advantage is impossible to beat even for skilled players. The house edge is different for each game. Most games have house edge around 5-7%. Online casinos have the same house edge as physical casinos, whereas they don’t provide such pleasures as physical casinos. Still, they account for the same profit. Decentralized casinos can decrease this to a fair level.

### Deposit and Withdrawal fees
Fiat currencies are hard to handle due to so many third parties and regulators. They take their chunk of profit for providing this service. Whereas they just only exchange IOUs between them which happens all digitally. This makes online gambling an expensive industry and a high entry barrier for new and small players. Cryptocurrency will enable decentralized casinos to reach the masses due to very low or no fees at all.

### Transparency
Transparency is the major problem for online casinos. Every online platform poker room in the World today ‘manufactures’ virtual playing cards with a computer random number generator program \(RNG\).  Search the term “poker is rigged” and you soon realize that many people do not trust a computer-generated deck of cards to deal a true game of poker, or indeed any online game that uses playing cards as a gambling instrument. 

To make large profits, online casinos can rig the odds to increase the house edge significantly. They don’t provide any way of checking the transparency. Fairness check has been conceptualized to introduce transparency in online casinos. But it has its own flaws and it’s hard for an end user to verify the fairness. Fairness check has its own loops and casinos have used it to deceive players looting their hard-earned money. Here is the case of 999dice.com at [ccn.com](https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-whale-gambler-says-99-9-dice-100-scam/) and [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=948965).

It is estimated that 1 in 3 gamblers do not trust RNG. It surprises people when they realize that a deck of playing cards is the only true random number generator when it comes to card games. Playing cards were invented over 1,000 years ago. Mathematicians state that the chance of anyone shuffling two decks of cards in the same way is infinitesimally small.  The number of permutations of a deck of cards are over eighty unvigintillion. But it’s an another problem to make honest shuffling of deck remotely without any trusted third party.

# The TrueDeck Solution
**By allowing data to be disseminated without being copied, blockchain technology is a game-changing evolution in payment security, designed for the digital-first consumer.** Developed as the underlying security system for bitcoin transactions, its database has no single point of entry through which it can be accessed by hackers and so information in a blockchain is securely shared without the risk of leakage.

In the last nine months of 2016, USD1.4 billion was invested globally in blockchain startups, with merchants in every industry excited by the technology’s possibilities. For online gambling operators, this offers lower costs and improved customer trust. It could also decentralize the industry and cause the biggest single disruption in the history of online gambling.

**At TrueDeck, we are primarily focusing to solve the transparency problem and to provide an open protocol for decentralized casinos.** Generating true random number is a hard task for blockchain. This poses a great problem for decentralized gambling games being implemented on blockchain. Fairness check for provably random numbers is being implemented by many blockchain casinos, also known as “provably fair” but it still has some flaws and exploit user experience towards the game. To an end user, it’s a hurdle to provide a random seed each time to play the game and fairness check makes no sense as an average player does not know much about cryptography.

The solution can be sectioned for two areas:
* Random Number Generation for games based on chance \(Dice, Roulette, Slot etc.\)
* Trustfree protocol for games based on skill and strategy \(Poker, Blackjack etc.\)

### Decentralized Random Number Generation
Decentralized Random Number Generation is an algorithm to generate a random number collaboratively where each participant has influence over the final number. It has many advantages over RNG mechanism, which is currently being used by many blockchain casino and jackpot lotteries. Previously, RNG mechanisms has been tempered for looting innocent people money. Also, there is no need of fairness check, as the random number is picked up collaboratively, so no single entity can tamper it to make it in their favor. Read more about it in [here](#decentralized-random-number-generation-drng).

### Mental Poker Protocol
In 1978 cryptographers Adi Shamir, Ron Rivest and Leonard Adleman published a paper which proposes an encryption scheme and communications protocol that allows two people at different locations to shuffle and deal cards without involving any third party. 
Mental Poker Protocol encrypts the deck so the cards are unreadable to any single player. To ensure fair shuffling of the cards, every player in the game shuffle the deck. The protocol allows each card be opened by one, some or the entire group. These features allow to create all variations of card games like Poker, Blackjack etc. Read more about it [here](#mental-poker-protocol).

Both **Decentralized Random Number Generation** and **Mental Poker Protocol** require enormous amounts of computational power and communications resources. So what will make us provide a blockchain solution for both problems? The answer is **sub-second confirmation blockchain implemented using EOSIO software** that will be able to achieve **5k transactions per second**. **EOSIO software will provide real-time on-chain performance to TrueDeck**.

# TrueDeck - True Potential
**TrueDeck platform has the true potential to make gambling in reach of billions.** As mentioned above, there are so many restrictions which creates a huge entry barrier for new players to join online gambling industry. Current online casinos are unable to provide the right solutions to make it to masses. TrueDeck is committed to provide these solutions and to remove all hurdles that come in a way of an average gambling lover.

## TrueDeck Platform
TrueDeck developers are working on ground-breaking technologies and bringing innovation to the gambling industry. TrueDeck platform will be open-source and fully transparent. The platform will comprise a number of technologies which will facilitate the development of complex gambling games.

### For Casino Owners
TrueDeck Platform will be a **“Casino-as-a-service”** where anyone with enough TDP tokens will be able to create his own casino over TrueDeck platform. **Casino can be deployed with just a few clicks.** The operator can choose to have only specific casino games from TrueDeck Marketplace and pay only for those games. The casinos will share the same features TrueDeck platform provides. However, Casino owners will be free to decide their own parameters like house edge, rake, commission, fees etc. They can also opt to support any cryptocurrency for their casino.

### For Developers & Designers
Developers & designers will be able to provide their services on TrueDeck Marketplace to develop new casino games or customize the existing ones according to the casino owner needs.

### For Players
Players will get a variety of options to play in different casinos and different games. All TrueDeck Platform Casinos  will share a common TrueDeck bankroll. That will enable mega jackpots and big rewards to the players without any middleman. Winnings will go straight into the players’ wallet.

*Learn more about TrueDeck Marketplace [here](#truedeck-marketplace).*

Below are the unique propositions that TrueDeck offers compared to its rivals:
### Network of Casinos
TrueDeck primary focus is to build a platform rather than only one casino. The platform provides protocol for others to build and operate casino. Anyone who wish to open a casino, can either use TrueDeck casino builder or customized one by using TrueDeck Marketplace offerings.

### TrueDeck Casino & Marketplace
Despite TrueDeck being a platform, it will be launching its own official casino with 0% house edge and rake free games. In order to expand this market to billions, TrueDeck Marketplace will facilitate the launch of new casinos by offering development services for casino games customization.

### Shared Bankroll, Large Payouts
All TrueDeck Platform Casinos will share the same bankroll creating the largest casino network. Large bankroll means mega jackpots and more players. Shared bankroll also eliminates the liquidity problem for a new casino. Through TrueDeck even new casinos can attract large player base.

### Lowest House Edge, Rake Free Games
TrueDeck Platform Casinos will compete with each other to attract more players by lowering house edge and offering better experience. Thus, TrueDeck platform will evolve into the best online gambling destination compared to its competitors. TrueDeck Official Casino will be committed to offer lowest house edge and rake free games.

### Transparent
In TrueDeck platform, every single action is committed to the public blockchain, making the platform fully transparent. Unlike other online casinos, who keeps their random number generation mechanisms behind the wall. 
There have been several incidents of tampering with RNG mechanisms where they are meant to be provably fair. One famous case can be found at [ccn.com](https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-whale-gambler-says-99-9-dice-100-scam/) and [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=948965). The mechanism to provide “fairness check” is a vague idea. To a user, who does not know much about cryptography, “fairness check” makes no sense.

### TrustFree
TrueDeck is coming up with mechanism and developing technologies which will ensure 100 percent trust for its players. The TrustFree mechanisms have been introduced for the better due to the transparency issues faced with “RNG mechanism”. Players can conduct game play as in a real world poker room without relying on a third party while playing on TrueDeck platform!

### Secure
Smart-Contracts are only smart when the creator have considered all vulnerabilities. But still, Smart-Contracts are not as smart as you think as described on [bitcoinist.com](http://bitcoinist.com/smart-contracts-might-not-smart-think/) and [bloomberg.com](http://bitcoinist.com/smart-contracts-might-not-smart-think/). There have been many incidents where hackers have drained the funds held by Smart-Contracts. Even some bounties for successfully attacking a project has been won by hackers, where project owners claimed their Smart-Contracts are 100% secure and have been audited by experts. TrueDeck developers are aware of this fact, that’s why all TrueDeck Smart-Contracts will undergo a rigorous byte-code level audit to ensure they're 100% secure.

### Reliable
Before the official launch, TrueDeck platform will be heavily tested in it’s beta for months to check the platform is consistently good in quality and performance. It will be load tested with heavy traffic to ensure the reliability even with millions of users.

### Fast
Despite TrueDeck is a blockchain casino and trustfree protocols will require enormous amounts of computational power & communications resources, users won't see any difference in speed and all the actions will be real-time.The deposits and withdrawals will also be lightning fast, charging nothing in fees. EOSIO Blockchain Software when developed completely will be able to achieve 5k transactions per second. That will be enough for a platform like TrueDeck. In future, if platform user-base grows further, TrueDeck could evolve into its own separate Blockchain based on EOSIO Software. 

EOS Blockchain is aiming to become a decentralized operating system. It will be somewhat a more focused product compared to Ethereum Blockchain. EOS is on its way to becoming the most widespread business and consumer oriented Blockchain platform, that works.

Apart from features mentioned above, TrueDeck will be committed to provide ultimate satisfaction to players as well as great opportunities to casino owners & developers.

## TrueDeck Casino
On TrueDeck Platform, anyone with enough TDP and SUIT tokens can open their own casino. But TrueDeck will be having it’s own casino “TrueDeck Casino” with lowest house edge and rake free games. On TrueDeck Casino, players will be able to play games using SUIT tokens only. Below is the comparison of other online casinos with TrueDeck Platform casinos.

|  | **Online Casino** | **Blockchain Casino \(Ethereum\)** | **TrueDeck \(EOS\)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| House Edge | 0.1% - 1% | 0% - 1% | Imperfect Play |
| Commission/Rake | 2.5% - 10% | 0% - 1% | Rake Free |
| Login/Registration Required | Yes | In some | No |
| On-chain Gameplay | - | Off-chain or lightning | Truly On-chain |
| Free Withdrawal/Deposit | No | TX Fees | Free |
| Withdrawal/Deposit Delay | Days | Minutes | Seconds |
| Random Number Based | Yes | Yes | No |
| Fairness Check | No | Yes | Not Required |
| Absence of Trusted Third Party | No | No | Yes |
| Casino Cheating Players | Possible | Still Possible | Impossible |

## TrueDeck Marketplace
TrueDeck will be having a marketplace of Casino dapps developed by individual developers and TrueDeck Dev team.  Casino owner will have a wide variety of dapps to chose from. They can also buy services of developers and designers to develop new games or customize the existing ones. Payments for these services can only be made in SUIT tokens.

# Token Mechanism

### TDP Token
TDP token is the governance token of TrueDeck Platform, just like EOS token is for EOS Blockchain.
* Total Supply: 200,000,000 TDP

### Casino as a Service
Using TrueDeck platform “Casino as a Service”, anyone would be able to launch their own casino. They can use existing casino dapps or customize them according to their need by hiring designers & developers from the TrueDeck marketplace. In order to open a casino, one will have to stake TDP tokens to acquire enough network bandwidth for its casino. Certain amount of SUIT tokens will also be mandatory to stake in “Bankroll Staking Utility”. This will also increase the public TrueDeck bankroll, hence bigger prizes to players.

# Market Analysis & Strategy
Based on geographical regions, the report segments the global online gambling and betting market into Europe, Asia and Middle East, North America, which are analyzed in terms of revenue generation. Europe is divided into the U.K., Malta, Gibraltar, France, Spain, Italy, Germany and Rest of Europe while North America is further segmented into the U.S., Canada and Rest of North America. Asia is subdivided into China, Japan, Australia, Philippines and Rest of Asia Pacific. Also, Middle East is further segmented into South Africa, Nigeria and Rest of Middle East.

### Global Online Gambling Market Analysis
Europe, Asia and Middle East being the biggest market will be the primary target for our customer acquisition. Our mission to make gambling in reach of billions will be possible if we make the platform scale to the global level. That’s why TrueDeck is being developed as a platform not as a single entity casino. It will be a whole ecosystem of Casino Owners, Investors, Developers & most importantly Players. TrueDeck intends to capture the most of this market through its transparency and fairness regarding House edge and commissions.

## Market Size
Since the gambling has gone online, it has seen astonishing growth. It has few reasons behind it like :
1. Easy & Convenient to use.
2. Fast and secure.
3. Variety of games and casinos available to choose from.
4. Multiple methods of payment are acceptable & much more.

Innovation & technology has taken online gambling to another level where it used to be $2 billion industry in early 2000’s, now it has crossed even $50 billion and soon to be $60 billion in 2020.

Market research report identifies that the easing of government regulations will be one of the primary growth drivers for the global online gambling market till 2021. Few years back the US passed a law that allowed individual states to license online casinos and mobile casinos, sports books, and poker sites within their borders. Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey are the three states in the US that allowed online gambling as of March 2017. It has been predicted that more states in the US may legalize the online gambling by 2020 due to the easing of laws by the federal government.
The Singapore government exempted two online gambling service providers called Turf Club and Singapore Pools from Remote Gambling Act in September 2016. The primary advantage in legalizing of online gambling is that it increases employment opportunity and benefit the government in the form of tax. These advantages are expected to motivate governments around the globe to legalize online gambling. Technavio's market research analysts predict that this market will grow at a CAGR of more than 9% by 2021. The global online gambling market is gaining popularity in Middle East and Africa because online sites generate huge revenue for the government. Their significant contribution to the national revenue is encouraging several countries across the region to legalize online gambling.

In addition, the online gambling market has been expanding in the UK after the implementation of the gambling act of 2006. This in turn, will boost the market's growth throughout the projected period.Competitive landscape and key vendors. The global online gambling market is characterized by the presence of several vendors competing to gain market dominance. Some of the small vendors are operating only in specific businesses such as casino and lottery, while, other vendors are operating in multiple fields including to retail betting. The growth opportunity for these vendors is increasing due to the rise in the number of gambling premises across the world and the increase in the number of participants. Furthermore, the rapid advancement in technology and frequent changes in consumer preferences will strengthen the competitive environment of the market.

## Consumer Analysis
TrueDeck believes in transparency though we won't mislead you with some irrelevant stats to show consumer data. We will in fact want to explain you about the people invest their assets & time in Online Gambling. Due to variety of games both genders enjoy playing online Gambling. The rate of women consumer in Online Gambling is higher than Offline gaming due to safety issues. UK & USA are now the most participating countries in world. Whereas middle aged people invest maximum in Online Gambling.

## Marketing Strategy
Marketing is the social process by which individuals and groups obtain what they need and want through creating and exchanging products and value with others. If there’s an influential individual who touches all your customers and has a significant impact on the way those customers try to solve their problem, one of your strategies may be to focus on building a strong relationship with that influential individual or company. Thus, best marketing strategy would be to create a strong consumer focused product and create a word-of-mouth phenomena through those influential individuals.

Our Marketing Strategy is simple & based on some principles like:
* Awareness
* Interest
* Evaluation
* Trail
* Adoption

Apart from this we are going to market from different resources. As TrueDeck is Online Gambling, the weigh towards Online Marketing would be more. The vision of TrueDeck is to spread awareness about Online Gambling & create a safe space for everyone to come and enjoy that. This kind of Market Strategy will helps us to connect more with our people. We will study market & through feedback receive what our client’s want & build up the same structure for them. There is no target audience for TrueDeck, anyone above legal age can come & play.

# JURY - The Backbone
JURY will be the backbone of TrueDeck platform. It will be a governed blockchain based on EOS.IO software with its own constitution. After so much research and testing, the idea of JURY has been conceived.

JURY, as a blockchain will have following higher level purposes:
* Fast Decentralized True Random Number Generation
* Storage of IPFS links having game data

Besides above purposes, Each JURY node will have following roles:
* **Tracker or DHT node:** To facilitate peer-to-peer communication
* **IPFS node:** To store the game data
* **Analyzer node:** Game data analytics to prevent and detect cheating

Being a governed blockchain, JURY will setup permission levels for each operation, so that only permitted entities can avail JURY services. But all data will be publicly visible for transparency and to verify the authenticity of actions. There will be following entities in JURY ecosystem:
1. Juror
2. Voter
3. Applier

### 1. Juror
A Juror will be a node in JURY blockchain and candidate for Block Producers as in EOS blockchain.  When not elected as block producer, Juror will work as a full node. The elected block producers for each round will be responsible to participate in “Decentralized Random Number Generation”. All Juror nodes whether elected as block producer or not, will work as an IPFS and Analyzer node. Jurors will be rewarded for their services and hard investments done to scale the JURY ecosystem. As JURY will be a governed blockchain, Jurors will have to submit their candidacy to be selected as juror. The approval of candidacy will be decided by voters.

### 2. Voter
All TDP token holders will be able to vote to elect a Juror as a block producer. TDP token holders will be responsible to choose the right candidates to keep the system secure from possible attacks. Those attacks can affect the value of their stake in TrueDeck.

### 3. Applier
Applier could be an individual or business who will use services offered by JURY in an application. All TrueDeck Platform casinos and TrueDeck casino itself will be an “applier”. An applier will have to stake a certain amount to use these services. Each services like random number generation or IPFS game data logging could be charged but that would be cheaper than current service providers, also trustfree and transparent. 


# TrueDeck & JURY Governance
TrueDeck platform and JURY will be governed by TDP token holders. TDP Token holders will be able to vote on all TrueDeck platform decisions as well as JURY Block Producer selection. Locked TDP tokens will also be considered for voting.

# TrueDeck Solution in detail
Following is the detailed technical explanation of solutions offered by TrueDeck.

## Decentralized Random Number Generation \(DRNG\)
Random number generation is main purpose of JURY. JURY uses a decentralized and collaborative  “commit-and-reveal” algorithm to generate a TDP random number.

The algorithm works like this:
1. For each new round, each JURY Block Producer \(JBP\) picks a secret number from 0 to M-1.
2. Each JBP appends a load of random gunk to its number and hashes the result with a secure hash.
3. Each JBP commits their hash to a smart contract.
4. When all JBP have committed the hash, each JBP reveals their secret number and random gunk, excepts the most voted JBP for that round.
5. The most voted JBP will reveal their secret number in the last, after other JBPs have revealed. Most voted JBP will have a better reward but worse punishment too.
6. A Smart-Contract verifies that the secret numbers and hashes match.
7. Failure to reveal or unmatched hash will result in not being selected as JBP for the next round due to less votes. In this case, a new round is started.
8. On successful match of hashes, the Smart-Contract will add all the secret numbers together modulo M, then adds 1 to get the final result to find the random number.

*There could be some possible attacks to this algorithm, but we are working to minimize those attacks.*

This random number can only be used by “Appliers” due to some permission levels set in JURY blockchain. The number will be quite big and can be used as seed to generate pseudo random numbers. A short random number will also be generated using this big random number to be used directly in many applications. So, end user can verify the authenticity of random number without much hassle on public block chain explorer.

## Mental Poker Protocol
The protocol allows players to conduct a card game remotely without trusting a third party. Each player encrypts the deck so the cards are unreadable to any single player. To ensure fair shuffling of the cards, every player in the game shuffle the deck. The protocol allows each card be opened by one, some or the entire group.
